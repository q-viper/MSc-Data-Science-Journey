## My Learning Journey While Studying MSc Data Science at FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg
Just some notes and exercises I tried to solve while preparing for exams.

## [Dynamical Systems Theory for Data Scientists](/DSDTS/)
This is one of the best courses I did where I learned about the stability of dynamical systems, Bifurcation theories, and some glimpses of Chaos Theory.

## [Deep Learning](DL/)
Learning mathematics behind the Neural Network is fun but what is more fun is coding them from scratch. I did some already a few years ago but I learned the easier way in this lecture. 
* ex1 contains FCNN
* ex2 contains CNN
* ex3 contains RNN

## [Cognitive Neuroscience for AI Developers](/CNAID/)
Not gonna lie I failed it once. But still fun because I got to learn some about how the brain functions and later on about the latest AI advancements.

## [Mathematics of Learning](/MOL/)
Started from algorithms and studied classical ML algorithms and Neural Networks but focused on Mathematics.

## [Mathematics Basics of AI and Data Analytics](/MBAID/)
Studied from the early history to how industry adapted Neural Networks in the early days.

## [Methods of Advanced Data Engineering](https://github.com/q-viper/MADE-WS23)
